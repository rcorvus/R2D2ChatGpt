## Add Environment Variable to your computer and reboot
``` OPENAI_API_KEY=my_openai_api_key ```

## Create a Dockerfile file (the .gitignore file keeps those out of source control)
Should look like this (be sure to include your own OPENAI_API_KEY)

```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM python:3.12

ENV OPENAI_API_KEY="my_openai_api_key"

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 50505

ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "app:app"]
```


## Installation

### Test your docker build
Start your docker app on your computer.

Build the docker image:
``` docker build -t r2d2chatgpt . ```

Run it locally:
``` docker run --detach --publish 5000:50505 r2d2chatgpt ```

In docker app, click on app and test that it runs correctly.

### Deploy your app to Azure:
```
az webapp up --runtime PYTHON:3.12 --sku F1 --logs --name r2d2chatgpt --location westus
```

####NOTE: If you get an error like "Insufficient permissions to create a zip in current directory. Please re-run the command with administrator privileges":
That means you need to close Visual Studio before running the above command again :-)


Set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable on your Azure deployment in the Configuration section:

Restart your Azure app after setting the environment variable.

Then go to:
``` http://r2d2chatgpt.azurewebsites.net ```


Locally or in a virtual env, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the libraries listed in requirements.txt:

For example:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
